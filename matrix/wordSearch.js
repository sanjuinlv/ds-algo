/* 
79. Word Search
https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/
Type: Medium

Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if word exists in the grid.
The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are
horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

Example 1:
|A,B,C,E|
|S,F,C,S|
|A,D,E,E|
Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCCED"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "SEE"
Output: true

Example 3:
Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCB"
Output: false
 
Constraints:
m == board.length
n = board[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 6
1 <= word.length <= 15
board and word consists of only lowercase and uppercase English letters.

/* 
Approach: Backtracking (with DFS)
Time: O(Nâ‹…3^L) where N is the number of cells in the board and L is the length of the word to be matched.
  - For the backtracking function, initially we could have at most 4 directions to explore, but further the choices are reduced into 3 (since we won't go back to where we come from).
  As a result, the execution trace after the first step could be visualized as a 3-nary tree, each of the branches represent a potential exploration in the corresponding direction. Therefore, in the worst case, the total number of invocation would be the number of nodes in a full 3-nary tree, which is about 3^L.
  - We iterate through the board for backtracking, i.e. there could be N times invocation for the backtracking function in the worst case.
Space: O(M * N), for tracking the visiste flag

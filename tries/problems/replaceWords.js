/* 
In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other word to 
form another longer word - let's call this word successor. For example, when the root 
"an" is followed by the successor word "other", we can form a new word "another".
Given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence consisting of words 
separated by spaces, replace all the successors in the sentence with the root forming it.
If a successor can be replaced by more than one root, replace it with the root that has
the shortest length.

Return the sentence after the replacement.

Example 1:
Input: dictionary = ["cat","bat","rat"], sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"

Example 2:
Input: dictionary = ["a","b","c"], sentence = "aadsfasf absbs bbab cadsfafs"
Output: "a a b c"

Example 3:
Input: dictionary = ["a", "aa", "aaa", "aaaa"], sentence = "a aa a aaaa aaa aaa aaa aaaaaa bbb baba ababa"
Output: "a a a a a a a a bbb baba a"

Example 4:
Input: dictionary = ["catt","cat","bat","rat"], sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"

Constraint:
    - 1 <= dictionary.length <= 1000
    - 1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 100
    - dictionary[i] consists of only lower-case letters.
    - 1 <= sentence.length <= 10^6
    - sentence consists of only lower-case letters and spaces.
    - The number of words in sentence is in the range [1, 1000]
    - The length of each word in sentence is in the range [1, 1000]
    - Each two consecutive words in sentence will be separated by exactly one space.
    - sentence does not have leading or trailing spaces.

Approach I: Prefix Hash
Time Complexity: O(âˆ‘w_i^2) where w_i is the length of the i-th word. 
We might check every prefix, the i-th of which is O(w_i^2) work.
The O(w) for creating prefix string and that is done w times, which is word length.
Space: O(N) where N is the length of our sentence; the space used by rootset.

648. Replace Words
https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-words/description/
Type: Medium

In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other word to 
form another longer word - let's call this word successor. For example, when the root 
"an" is followed by the successor word "other", we can form a new word "another".
Given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence consisting of words 
separated by spaces, replace all the successors in the sentence with the root forming it.
If a successor can be replaced by more than one root, replace it with the root that has
the shortest length.

Return the sentence after the replacement.

Example 1:
Input: dictionary = ["cat","bat","rat"], sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"

Example 2:
Input: dictionary = ["a","b","c"], sentence = "aadsfasf absbs bbab cadsfafs"
Output: "a a b c"

Example 3:
Input: dictionary = ["a", "aa", "aaa", "aaaa"], sentence = "a aa a aaaa aaa aaa aaa aaaaaa bbb baba ababa"
Output: "a a a a a a a a bbb baba a"

Example 4:
Input: dictionary = ["catt","cat","bat","rat"], sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"

Constraint:
    - 1 <= dictionary.length <= 1000
    - 1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 100
    - dictionary[i] consists of only lower-case letters.
    - 1 <= sentence.length <= 10^6
    - sentence consists of only lower-case letters and spaces.
    - The number of words in sentence is in the range [1, 1000]
    - The length of each word in sentence is in the range [1, 1000]
    - Each two consecutive words in sentence will be separated by exactly one space.
    - sentence does not have leading or trailing spaces.

/* 
Approach I: Prefix Hash
Time Complexity: O(âˆ‘w_i^2) where w_i is the length of the i-th word. 
We might check every prefix, the i-th of which is O(w_i^2) work.
The O(w) for creating prefix string and that is done w times, which is word length.
Space: O(N) where N is the length of our sentence; the space used by rootset.

/*
Approach I: Trie
Let d be the number of words in the dictionary, s be the number of words in the sentence, and w be the average length of each word.

Time Complexity: O(d * w + s * w)
Creating the Trie takes O(d * w). Creating the data structure that stores the words in the sentence takes O(s * w).
The loop in the shortestRoot function runs once for each letter in the word. If a corresponding prefix is found, it creates one substring, which takes O(w). Therefore, the time complexity of finding the shortest root is O(w).
The main loop calls the shortestRoot function once for each word in the sentence, so it takes O(s * w).

Converting the result to a string takes O(s * w).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(d * w +2 * s * w), which we can simplify to O(d * w + s * w).

Space Complexity: O(d * w + s * w)
The Trie may store up to O(d * w) nodes. The data structure that stores the words in the sentence uses O(s * w) space.

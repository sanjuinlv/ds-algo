Tips for great answers:
- Practice using the STAR method to answer the behavioral-based interview questions listed above,
 incorporating examples from the Amazon Leadership Principles.
- Ensure each answer has a beginning, middle, and end. Describe the situation or problem,
 the actions you took, and the outcome.
- Prepare short descriptions of a handful of different situations and be ready to answer follow-up
 questions with greater detail. Select examples that highlight your unique skills.
- Have specific examples that showcase your experience, and demonstrate that you’ve taken risks,
 succeeded, failed and grown in the process.
- Specifics are key; avoid generalizations. Give a detailed account of one situation for each
 question you answer, and use data or metrics to support your example.
- Be forthcoming and straightforward. Don't embellish or omit parts of the story.

Ownership:
Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job." 

Provide an example of when you personally demonstrated ownership.

2. Tell me about a time you went above and beyond.
3. Tell me about a time when you took on something significant outside your area of responsibility. Why was it important? What was the outcome?
4. Describe a project or idea (not necessarily your own) that was implemented primarily because of your efforts. What was your role? What was the outcome?
5. Give an example of when you saw a peer struggling and decided to step in and help. What was the situation and what actions did you take? What was the outcome?

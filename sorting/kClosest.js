https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/
Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

Example 1:
Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation:
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].

Example 2:
Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
Explanation: The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.

Constraints:

1 <= k <= points.length <= 10^4
-10^4 < xi, yi < 10^4

/* 
Approach III: Using Quick Select

Time: O(N) Similar to the binary search solution, the QuickSelect solution
has a worst-case time complexity of O(N^2) if the worst pivot is chosen each time. 
On average, however, it has a time complexity of O(N) because it halves (roughly)
the remaining elements needing to be processed at each iteration.

Space: O(1) The QuickSelect algorithm conducts the partial sort of points in place
with no recursion, so only constant extra space is required

/* 
DP is variation of recursion
If there are more than one function call in recursion then we need DP. 
If there is only one call in recursion then DP will not be applicable.
If a problem statement asks for Optimal Solution then we need DP. E.g, min, max, largest ect

for DP problem we should try to identify following:
 - Base case: Think of smallest & valid inout
 - Choice Diagram: Think of options/branches
 - Make inout smaller

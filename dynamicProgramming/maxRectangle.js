/**
85. Maximal Rectangle
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-rectangle
Type: Hard
 
Given a rows x cols binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle 
containing only 1's and return its area.

Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The maximal rectangle is shown in the above picture.

Input: matrix = []
Output: 0

Input: matrix = [["0"]]
Output: 0

Input: matrix = [["1"]]
Output: 1

Input: matrix = [["0","0"]]
Output: 0

rows == matrix.length
cols == matrix.length
0 <= row, cols <= 200
matrix[i][j] is '0' or '1'.

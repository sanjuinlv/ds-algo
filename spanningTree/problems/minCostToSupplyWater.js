1168. Optimize Water Distribution in a Village
https://leetcode.com/problems/optimize-water-distribution-in-a-village/solution/
Category - Hard

There are n houses in a village. We want to supply water for all the houses by
building wells and laying pipes.

For each house i, we can either build a well inside it directly with cost wells[i - 1]
(note the -1 due to 0-indexing), or pipe in water from another well to it. 
The costs to lay pipes between houses are given by the array pipes where each
pipes[j] = [house1j, house2j, costj] represents the cost to connect house1j and house2j 
together using a pipe. Connections are bidirectional, and there could be multiple
valid connections between the same two houses with different costs.

Return the minimum total cost to supply water to all houses.

Example 1:

Input: n = 3, wells = [1,2,2], pipes = [[1,2,1],[2,3,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: The image shows the costs of connecting houses using pipes.
The best strategy is to build a well in the first house with cost 1 and connect the other houses to it with cost 2 so the total cost is 3.

Example 1:

Input: n = 2, wells = [1,1], pipes = [[1,2,1],[1,2,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: We can supply water with cost two using one of the three options:
Option 1:
  - Build a well inside house 1 with cost 1.
  - Build a well inside house 2 with cost 1.
The total cost will be 2.
Option 2:
  - Build a well inside house 1 with cost 1.
  - Connect house 2 with house 1 with cost 1.
The total cost will be 2.
Option 3:
  - Build a well inside house 2 with cost 1.
  - Connect house 1 with house 2 with cost 1.
The total cost will be 2.
Note that we can connect houses 1 and 2 with cost 1 or with cost 2 but we will always choose the cheapest option. 

Constraints:

 - 2 <= n <= 10^4
 - wells.length == n
 - 0 <= wells[i] <= 10^5
 - 1 <= pipes.length <= 10^4
 - pipes[j].length == 3
 - 1 <= house1j, house2j <= n
 - 0 <= costj <= 10^5
 - house1j != house2j

Approach I: Krushkal's Algorithm with UnionFind

Let N be the number of houses, and M be the number of pipes from the input.

Time: O((N + M) * Log (M + N))
  - First, we build a list of edges, which takes O(N + M) time.
  - We then sort the list of edges, which takes O((N + M)* log(N + M)) time.
  - At the end, we iterate through the sorted edges. For each iteration, 
   we invoke a Union-Find operation. Hence, the time complexity for iteration
   is O((N + M) * Î±(N)).
  - overall O((N + M)* log(N + M)).

Space: O(N + M)
  - The space complexity of our Union-Find data structure is O(N).
  - The space required by the list of edges is O( N + M).
  - Space complexity for sorting O(log N)
  - so overall O (N + M)

Approach: Backtracking
Time: O(N-M), where N is a number of cells in the room and M is a number of obstacles.
 - We visit each non-obstacle cell once and only once.
 - At each visit, we will check 4 directions around the cell. Therefore, the total
  number of operations would be 4 * (N âˆ’ M).
Space: O(N-M), where N is a number of cells in the room and M is a number of obstacles.
We employed a hashtable to keep track of whether a non-obstacle cell is visited or not.
